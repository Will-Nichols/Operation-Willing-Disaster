                "After 3 months of fighting and getting hammered relentlessly the men of the 45th Division (Airborne) completed loading of the final Xian Y-20 transport aircraft at the airbase in the NW sector of the Tanoan Archipelago and also loaded the final armored vehicles into the container ship at the port and were escorted out of the Tanoan airspace and waters by aircraft and ships of the US And Australian Navy. The men of the 45th PLA Division (Airborne) and 1st Brigade PLAN had executed a brilliant attack on the Tanoan Archipelago. Unfortunately for Chinese and CSAT interests they were thwarted by a significant insurgency aimed at breaking the back of the individual chinese soldiers, aviators and marines. The Tanoan insurgents were able to do this with outstanding support from the members of the US Special Forces, who were already scheduled to be working in the region to assist TDF troops with training and establishing a permanent US military base; which the CSAT and Chinese governments were vehemently opposed to. The results were that the individual members of the Tanoan Archipelago joined the resistance of the insurgents and since almost all were former members of the TDF they were more than capable of working as a military unit and exploited weaknesses in the Chinese and CSAT logistics chain by destroying and or capturing several high value equipment depots and many chinese soldiers who were transported by the US Navy covertly back to US territory to be tried publicly for warcrimes. The court of public opinion went heavy against the Chinese and CSAT governments and forced them into accepting an unconditional peace after it was reported that the 45th Division and the 1st Brigade PLAN were down to just a few skeleton companies out of the thousands that they invaded with just a few months before.<br/><br/>
				
				(2) Capabilities: CSAT and Chinese special operations personnel and intelligence agents are working to rebuild the pre-war network of rebels and terrorists that sent the Tanoan Archipelago into a tailspin just before they invaded. It is up to members of Task Force Red to eliminate or capture these agents, terrorists and criminals and bring them to justice.<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: The activity levels of the foreign agents and terrorists is very high but scattered. In order to proceed with the IDAP security mission and the kill or capture of HVT's TF Red personnel will be detailed on an as needed basis for various missions all around the archipelago.<br/><br/>b. Friendly Forces - Task Force Red:<br/><br/>US SOCOM Thor, Phantom and Firehawk will be detailed as needed to work with IDAP personnel and TDF forces to revitalize and secure the infrastructure that was destroyed during the conflict as well as help secure against terrorism and criminal activity in the Archipelago.<br/><br/>The local rebel and crminal forces are extremely well armed with various weapon systems and vehicles that they are able to utilize after significant stockpiles of weapons and equipment were left behind when the US Marines and Special Forces left the area to return to the US Mainland. There are many former members of the various Molokous cells that are operating against the TDF and the Tanoan government and intelligence is sure they will act against the IDAP members as well.<br/><br/>It is unknown who leader of the rebel forces is or where their leadership is located exactly but they are working in the area of the central valley east of Georgetown and the CSAT/Chinese agents are known to be working in all areas of Tanoa as well and are to be considered targets of opportunity."
